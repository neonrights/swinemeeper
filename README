Code repository for minesweeper solver created for final project of CS261A: Problem Solving and Search taught by UCLA professor Richard Korf.  The solver works by treating minesweeper as a constraint satisfaction problem where each space is a boolean variable where 0 is a clear space and 1 contains a bomb.

For more information please read the paper available under `article\minesweeper.pdf`.
